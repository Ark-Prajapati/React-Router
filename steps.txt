1. install library.

2. copy header tailwind code from github (of Header)

    inside it, is link and navLink. what are they? 
    things you get with the router library. you have to import it from the library (import {link, navlink from react router dom})

    link, used in place of 'a' tag.
    'a' tag, when used, whole page is refreshed. In react there is not concept like that, DOM just goes and values are injected.
    instead of 'a', we use 'to' here

3.  NavLink, gives additional things.
    the className inside navlink, it has a callback function. 
    color highlighting on links based on where the page user is. to do that, its used. 
    then we manipulate the classes. how?
    u get access to a variable called {isActive}. inject it in the code (do see where you inject it), and write it such that if its true then this or else this.
    navlink then would tell you if the page you are in is active or not.

4. 3 components are build. in src, 3 folders, in each one, their respective file, and tailwind code copied from github.

5. we won't be returning the app.jsx.
    in main.jsx, we were rendering app.jsx, instead of it, do routerProvider. it needs router.

6. creating router

what we want, header and footer to stay same. home, different componet, contact us, then diff one.
one way, call headder in each component. not a optimised way

other way, a new file, Layout.jsx, in src.
